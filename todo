 nov 16 -> computeTopologicalSort
 nov 20 -> computeMinimumSpanningTree
 nov 21 -> program cleanup and submission

 functions completed:
 readGraph
 printGraph
 computeTopologicalSort

questions:
could we create the in-degree vector during read graph by incrementing with each toVertexName
how to make computeShortestPaths more readable
